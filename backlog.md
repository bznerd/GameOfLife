# General TODOs
* Implement an infinite grid backend
* Scrolling game window
* Clean up GUI interface in main.pyw
* Allow selection of game backend from command line

### Nice features if time permits:
* Performance analysis (maybe improvements) of different backends
* Loading mechanism for start configurations
* Variable zoom on game window
